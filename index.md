Course webpage for the NYU Spring 2025 Course Special Topics in Data Science, DS-GA 3001.003/.004 (Introduction to Computer Vision). This course is aims to cover a broad topics in computer vision, and is *not* primarily a deep learning course. We will covert topics in traditional computer vision such as camera geometry, image formation, segmentation, object recognition, classification, and detection (see [Syllabus](#Syllabus)).


### Logistics

* DS-GA 3001.003 (Lecture) \
Mondays 4:55pm-6:35pm  \
**Location**: 60 Fifth Ave, Room 150

The class will be in-person. Slides will be available after the class on this webpage. (see [Schedule](#Schedule)).

* DS-GA 3001.004 (Lab) \
Thursdays 4:55pm-5:45pm \
**Location**: Silver Center, Room 401, 31 Washington Place

The labs will be in-person. Labs will be used to cover additional materials or to work through practical exercises with the TA.
